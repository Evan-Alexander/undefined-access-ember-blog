  "content": "If you accept we live in a systematical universe that is ruled by quantum physics than it is not hard to imagine multiple dimensions or realms that we just dont have the correct senses to see/feel/taste/hear or smell it in the way we as humans accept as fact. They exist and just partially in the dimensions that we understand and can interact with but they exist completely in the universe.",

  "content": "Ive been reading these posts for days now and am trying to learn as much as I can. Ive seen many posts including terms such as greys and reptilians and more. Are these referred to as the species of ETs (whats the politically correct way to say this other than species?)? Can someone explain them to me or tell me where to read more? And what are the main types of species?",
